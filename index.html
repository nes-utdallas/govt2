<h1> (8/21/19) the political culture, people, and economy of texas</h1>
<ul>
<li>texas is "a state of mind...a mystique closely approximating a religion"</li>
<li>myths about texas (cowboy image, ranchers, wildcatter, independent entrepreneur)</li>
<li>reality of texas today is more complicated</li>
<li>texas is second most populous state</li>
<li>much more diverse than commonly thought</li>
<li>increasing racial and ethnic diversity points to new texas, no longer dominated by republican party</li>
<li><strong>political culture</strong> is broadly shared values, beliefs, and attitudes about how govt + society should function</li>
<li>american pol culture is viewed as emphaziing liberty, equality, democracy</li>
<li>texas is categorized as having a "<strong>traditionalistic individualistic</strong>" <strong>pol culture</strong></li>
<li>moralist says take care of everybody, individualist says everybody takes care of themselves</li>
<li>the one-party state: for over a century, texas was dem, 90s republicans secured control by 2002 with redistricting</li>
<li>texas pol culture was once defined by <strong>provincialism</strong>, a narrow view associated with rural values and notions of limited govt, result was often a self-interested view of the world and intolerance of diversity</li>
<li>texas pol culture defined by dominance of business</li>
<li>labor unions are rare, poorly organized and poorly funded</li>
<li>its a big state</li>
<li>large portion of public lands are in private ownership</li>
<li>the gulf coastal plains: timber production, oil fields, plantation life, urban - dem + suburbs - republican</li>
<li>interior lowlands: agriculture, ranches, conservative</li>
<li>great plains: agriculture, cotton, ranching, petroleum, conservative</li>
<li>basin and range: mountains, little rain, few people, large latino pop, democratic</li>
<li>joseph schumpeter, "creative destruction"</li>
<li>periodic wave of transformation fueled by tech innovations in production and distribution</li>
<li>capitalist process creates new economy, destroys old ones</li>
<li>schumpter's theory provides useful way to think about economic changes that have shaped and reshaped the texas economy</li>
<li><strong>cotton</strong>: cotton is one of the oldest crops grown in texas, cotton production cycles go up and down, 1930 census shows 61% of farmers were tenant farmers and 1/3 of those were sharecroppers, fell throughout great depression, by 1987 only 12% were tenant farmers, one quarter of all US cotton comes from texas</li>
<li><strong>cattle</strong>: history of ranching and cattle industry parallels cotton, industry took off following civil war, neither cotton nor ranching is as important now as it was in the past, in the early 20th century, new technological breakthroughs focused on what lay beneath land, not on it</li>
<li><strong>oil and gas</strong>: oil took off in 1901 with discovery of spindletop oilfield, oil fever for next decade, rise + decline + rise again seen through production figures, major discovery that brought new oil and gas to market lead to a sudden collapse in prices, a boom-and-bust mentality was introduced</li>
<li><strong>oil and gas (continued)</strong>: oil and gas transformed govt + economy, power of govt was expanded through railroad commission, higher education has benefited, oil and gas production is emerging agin in texas economy, which will result in new demands for water supplies and new environmental concerns</li>
<li><strong>high-tech industries</strong>: world oil prices began to collapse in 1982, texas emerged in 80s as leader in high-tech industries, 90s texas went from 7th in nation in total manufacturing employment to 2nd, in 2015 14.34 percent of total output in the state came from manufacturing, and 7.3 percent of the workforce was employed in manufacturing</li>
<li><strong>NAFTA</strong>: in 1992 the <strong>North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)</strong> was signed which created a free-trade zone among the US, Canada, and Mexico, texas exports increased, although there were some NAFTA losers, there were also big winners</li>

<h1> (8/26/19)</h1>
<ul>
<li>three factors account for population growth in texas
<ol>
	<li>natural increase (births)</li>
	<li>international immigration</li>
	<li>domestic immigration</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>texas's population in 2017 was estimated to be over 28 mil</li>
<li><strong>whites (anglos)</strong>: for most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, dom ethnic group was non-hispanic whites; first wave was encouraged by <strong>empresarios</strong> such as moses austin + son stephen f. austin; as a percentage of the population, white pop peaked at 74% in 1950; percentage began to fall, reaching 43.5% in 2015, will likely continute to fall</li>
<li><strong>latinos</strong>: most latinos in texas are of mexican descent; until 1900, latinos were concentrated in south texas, by 2000, latinos constituted majorities in san antonio + el paso and sizable minorities in other cities; political status of latinos in texas has changed considerably over the past 100 years; number of latinos elected to public office rose from 1466 (1986) to 2521 (2011)</li>
<li><strong>latinos (continued)</strong>: political status has changed considerably over the past 100 years; white-only primary and the <strong>poll tax</strong> actively discouraged voting by latinos; in 1956, henry b gonzalez became first mexi american to be elected to texas senate in modern times; la raza unida party emerged in mid-1960s</li>
<li><strong>african americans</strong>: people of african descent were among earliest explorers in texas; most african americans, however, entered the state as slaves; mexican authorities' antislavery attitudes kept the black population relatively low (5000 in 1830) until texas revolution and expansion of slavery; emancipation (june 19, 1865) did not bring anything approaching equality</li>
<li><strong>african americans (continued)</strong>: black codes restricted rights of former slaves; federal court cases in 40s + 50s offered some hope of relief; civil rights act (64) + voting rights (65) helped open political system to african americans; in 72 barbara jordan became first african american woman to be elected to the us house of representatives from texas</li>
<li><strong>asians</strong>: in 2017, us census bureau estimated over 1 mil asians resided in texas (5% of state pop)</li>
<li><strong>age</strong>: pop of texas is relatively young in comparison with rest of nation; in 2015, 27.3% of pop was estimated to be under 18yrs old, compared with 24% nationally</li>
<li><strong>poverty and wealth</strong>: despite growth of the 90s, incomes in texas have lagged behind those of nation as a whole</li>
<li><strong>urbanization</strong>: much of texas's history is linked to ongoing <strong>urbanization</strong>; by the 21st century, the process of urbanization was largely complete; now 85% of pop resides in urban areas; urbanization and accompanying suburbanization are the forces driving politics in modern texas</li>
<li><strong>houston</strong>: houston is largest city in texas, with a pop of 2.1 mil, it is the fourth largest city in the us; it is the second- or third- busiest deep-water port in the us (depending on which ranking is used); oil fundamentally transformed the houston area and made houston one of the leading energy centers int he world</li>
<li><strong>dallas-fort worth</strong>: the metroplex consists of dallas, fort worth, and a number of other suburban cities; with the discovery of oil in east texas in 1930, dallas became a major center for petroleum financing; dallas looks to east and embodies a more corporate culture; fort worth looks west and since the two world wars has emerged as the home of a large aviation industry</li>
<li><strong>san antonio</strong>: san antonio is texas's second-largest city; san antonio's population increasingly latino; san antonio lacks high-paying manufacturing jobs, average metropolitan income is lower than in houston and dallas; economy rests on national military bases, educational institutions, tourism, and a large medical research complex</li>
<li><strong>austin</strong>: as the state capital, austin is the hub for government business; it is the fourth-largest metropolitan area in texas; austin is the location of the university of texas at austin - the flagship institution of the university of texas system; austin has a thriving high-tech industry; austin's per capita income and median household income are both greater than their corresponding state averages</li>
<li>economy and people of texas have becme diversified</li>
<li>texas has become a melting pot of cultures and concerns</li>
<li>future of texas likely will continue to be defined by economic and demographic changes
<ul>
<li>latinos will play an increasingly important role in the economic and political life of texas</li>
<li>president trump's call to reevaluate nafta may change texas's connection with the world economy</li>
</ul>

<h1>(8/28/19) federalism</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>us v lopez</strong>: congress passes gun free school zones act (1990); made it illegal to possess a gun in a school zone, or within 1000 feet; passed by democrat congress, signed into law by george h.w. bush; alfonso lopez jr., high school senior who was charged under texas law first for possessing a handgun and bullets at san antonio high school (march 1992)</li>
<li><strong>us v lopez (background)</strong>: state charges were dropped after federal charges filed; convicted in federal district court; court ruled congress had power to regulate the "business" of elementary, middle, and high schools; fifth circuit court of appeals overturns the decision; claims law is unconstitutional based on commerce clause; us argued the act was constitutional because buying and selling guns and associated illicit activities affect interstate commerce; gun violence in schools leads to both more dangerous and thus less commercially healthy neighborhoods and less economically productive kids; supreme court rules 5-4 in favor of lopez</li>
<li><strong>william rehnquist majority opinion</strong>: "the act neither regulates a commercial activity nor contains a requirement that the possession be connected in any way to interstate commerce"; commerce can be regulated by the federal government if it falls in any of three broad categories:
<ul>
<li>use of channels of interstate commerce</li>
<li>instrumentalities of interstate commerce</li>
<li>activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce</li>
</ul>
immediately tosses out the first two possibilities; the law does not regulate channels or instrumentalities of interstate commerce; leaves only the possibility of substantial relation to interstate congress; rehnquist notes the court has done a good job at describing what commerce is, but admits the court has done a poor job at defining interstate commerce</li>
<li><strong>are guns at school commerce?</strong>: government argument is that possession of a firearm may increase violent crime and violent crime affects the national economy in two ways:
<ul>
<li>violent crime increases insurance rates, which affect everyone in the population</li>
<li>violent crime makes people less willing to travel to unsafe areas</li>
</ul>
also argues that guns in school lead to poor education, which in turn produces less productive citizens</li>
<li><strong>why is is not commerce?</strong>: the "cost of crime" argument, if that holds true, then congress can regulate anything that could potentially lead to crime; "national productivity" argument, if that holds true, congress can regulate any activity it feels affects economic productivity; both education and criminal law are constitutionally protected areas of state sovereignty; "if we were to accept the government's arguments, we are hard presses to posit any activity by an individual that congress is without popwer to regulate"</li>
<li><strong>justice breyer dissent</strong>: the gfsza does fall under commerce clause because the court must not consider an individual instance, but the effect of guns at every school; supreme court should also defer to congress' authority by not basing the decision on if the "regulated activity sufficiently affected interstate commerce", but if congress had a rational basis to think it would; several studies indicate that violent crime lowers economic output and crime in schools lowers educational outcomes</li>
<li><strong>effects on federal-state relations</strong>: the first supreme court decision since the great depression to limit congress' commerce clause power; reaffirms constitutional provision that certain powers are reserved to the states; signals to states a change in the court's federalism jurisprudence</li>
<li><strong>elazar's three factors</strong>: three factors drive how each state derives their individual factors
<ol>
<li>political culture: the particular pattern of orientation to political action in which the political system is embedded</li>
<li>frontier: the constant effort of americans to extend their control over their environment for human benefit</li>
<li>sectionalism: the more or less permanent ties that link together groups of contiguous states or segments of states with bonds of shared interests</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>power versus justice</strong>: there are two poles of government
<ol>
<li>power is "who gets what, when, and how"; civil society</li>
<li>justice is the desire to become a good society</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>the four tendencies</strong>
<ol>
<li>efficiency: getting results in the least wasteful manner, minimizing expenses</li>
<li>commerce: exchange of ideas, goods, and services</li>
<li>legitimacy: underlying values of the citizenry</li>
<li>agrarianism: self-governing freeholders, general diffusion of knowledge, religion, and morality</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>three political cultures</strong>:
<ol>
<li>individualistic: government should not be concerned with the good society; limit interaction by government into private activities; politicians are treated as "business" people; political parties then become "business corporations"; this promotes professional politicians</li>
<li>moralistic: politics main goal should be the good society; politics is a public activity centered on the public good; social issues tend to be the focal point; politicians should build relationships and loyalties; parties are useful, not necessary; promotes amateur politician instead of professional</li>
<li>traditionalistic: government is paternalistic and elitist; confines political power to a small ruling class; citizens are only expected to be minimally active in politics; politicians first responsibility is to themselves and their family; political parties are virtually nonexistent, or one-party dominant</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>frontiers</strong>: america has always sought new frontiers; "the conquest of one frontier has led to the opening of another"; rural-land frontier, settling the land, agricultural based; urban-industrial frontier: urbanization and manufacturing; metropolitan-technological frontier: suburbanization and new technology</li>
<li><strong>sectionalism</strong>: "sections are not homogeneous socioeconomic units sharing a common character across state lines"; set of common political interests that allow coordination on both social and economic issues; differs from regionalism; regionalism represents a common interest over specific single issue; sections continue to have intra-sectional conflict, but overall have strong sectional bonds on national issues</li>
</ul>

<h1>(9/4/19) the texas constitution</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>why the texas constitution matters</strong>: the texas constitution is a legal framework with which the govt works; rights guaranteed in the texas constitution go beyond those of the us constitution; texas constitution has an immediate and enormous impact on citizens' everyday lives, perhaps even more than the us constitution; the length and detail of the texas constitution make the amendment process central to the political process; voter approval is necessary for proposed amendments</li>
<li><strong>the role of a state constitution</strong>: state <strong>constitutions</strong> perform a number of important functions; establish political institutions and explain the source of their power and authority; delegate powers to particular institutions and individuals and define how those powers are to be used; responsible for establishment of local govts; protect against concentration of pol power in one institution or individual; define limits of pol power</li>
<li><strong>texas's constitution is heavily influenced by us one</strong>: political power is derived from the people; both constitutions feature a <strong>separation of powers</strong>, legislative, executive, judicial; a system of <strong>checks and balances</strong> limits the power of each branch, as a way to protect against <strong>tyranny</strong>; certain <strong>individual rights</strong> must not be violated such as freedom of speech, assembly, religion, etc; the idea of <strong>federalism</strong> is also embodied in the constitutions of the us and texas</li>
<li><strong>important differences btwn us and texas constitution</strong>: <strong>supremacy clause</strong> us const and federal laws are supreme law of land; <strong>necessary and proper clause</strong> the federal govt has all authority it needs to carry out its powers, drafters of texas consts have been unwilling to grant the govt this level of discretionary power; texas const guarantees other rights, not found in the us const, such as the right to have an "efficient system of public free schools"</li>
<li>texas has many myths surrounding its origins, and separating these myths from historical fact is important in understanding the development of texas as a state; six different consts governed the state prior to the current const; each reflects different national priorities, different issues of the time, and different values of writers; current texas const is product of a long course of political and legal development in the state</li>
<li>texas had a founding period that was much longer than the us; period of discontent, independence declaration; differences and similarities in terms of the characteristics of the founding period in comparison with that of the us</li>
<li>after challenges to spanish rule by spanish texans, texas gained independence from spain with mexico in 1821; first federal constitution that texas operated under was mexican constitution of 1824; embodied many of the ideas found in the us const; one important difference: catholicism was established as state religion and supported financially by the state</li>
<li>texas gained independence from spain with mexico in 1821; <strong> constitution of coahuila y tejas, 1827</strong>; the mexican const combined the state of coahuila and province of texas: "coahuila y tejas"; the state const of 1827 made texas the district of bexar, defined a <strong>unicameral</strong> legislature, and guaranteed liberty, security, property, and equality; catholicism was established religion</li>
<li><strong>constitution of republic of texas, 1836</strong>: texas's break with mexico was in part of a constitutional crisis; among texas resident demands were a more liberal immigration policy for people from us, establishment of english and spanish speaking primary schools, and separate statehood for texas, apart from coahuila</li>
<li><strong>the texas declaration of independence</strong>: adopted in 1836 at washington-on-the-brazos; 39 of the 59 delegates were from southern slave states; only 10 of 59 had lived in mexico prior to 1830; like the founders during the american revolution, leaders of texas revolution justified their actions in print drawing on john locke's litany of reasons for establishing govt and thomas jefferson's cataloged list of grievances</li>
<li><strong>constitution of republic of texas, 1836</strong>: resembled us constitution in being brief and flexible; established an elected chief executive, a <strong>bicameral</strong> legislature, and a four-tiered judicial system; guaranteed white male suffrage; defended slavery as an institution; under this constitution texas pop skyrocketed; although const called for annexation by the us, texas remained independent republic</li>
<li><strong>texas state constitution of 1845</strong>: annexed as a state in 1845, ceded defense-related property to the us but retained vacant land; state could break up into four additional states when pop proved adequate; new and longer const provided for two legislative houses, elected governor and lieutenant governor, a judicial branch, and a process for amending the constitution</li>
<li><strong>constitution of 1861: texas joins confederacy</strong>: secession convention of 1861 proclaimed the laws and constitutions of union trampled on the rights of texas, especially with regard to slavery; texas voters approved secession and state entered <strong> confederacy</strong>; new constituion declared freeing of slaves illegal, but there were few changes otherwise; public officials had to declare allegiance to the confederacy and slavery and states' rights were defended</li>
<li><strong>constitution of 1866: texas rejoins</strong>: ratified by slim majority, new const following defeat in civil war accepted abolition of slavery; black codes (freed men were allowed to own property and to sue but were banned from voting or holding office); under provisions of president johnson's "presidential reconstruction", few former secessionists were excluded from voting; congresional apportionment would be based only on the number of white male citizens; const of 1866 was, essentially, amended version of 1861</li>
</ul>

<!---->

<h1>(9/9/19)</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Reconstruction Constitution of 1869</strong>: confederate states required new state constitutions to comply with federal laws; congressional reconstruction acts of 1867; <strong>radical republicans</strong> won vote for a convention; new constitution, published over military orders, extended the vote and political equality to black men, 13th + 14th amendments; governor, edmund davis, given vastly expanded powers</li>
<li><strong>constitution of 1876</strong>: constitutional convention of 1875 generated new constitution; 40 of the delegates were members of the grange; still basis of texas govt today; four goals of constitution: strong pop control of govt; limits to power; restraints to spending; promotion of agricultural interests</li>
<li>the new limits on govt were in many ways a reaction to governor davis; judges to be elected; governors power diffused; part-time legislature; limits salaries of govt officials, extent of govt debt, and power to tax; segregated schools; regulation of railroad and banks</li>
<li>texas constitution is notoriously poor; outdated and overamended (498 amendments, <strong>limited govt</strong>); written to prevent expansion of govt authority; makes it difficult for officials to govern efficiently; enables special interest groups</li>
<li><strong>preamble</strong>: surprisingly short</li>
<li><strong>article 1: bill of rights</strong>: rights are listed up front; right to <strong>republican govt</strong> is powerfully articulated; much more detailed and specific than us one</li>
<li><strong>article 2: powers of govt</strong>: three branches (legislative, executive, judicial); one short paragraph of text</li>
<li><strong>article 3: legislative department</strong>: texas house of representatives and senate; limits on salaries; texas ethics commissions; comptroller of public accounts; largest portion of article 3 is dedicated to addressing variety of policy issues</li>
<li><strong>article 4: executive department</strong>: creates a <strong>plural executive</strong>: executive department consists of six offices, five of which are elected, not just the governor, secretary of state is appointed by governor with senate approval; independently elected offices limit govt power; different parties may hold executive power, providing additional check against concentration of power</li>
<li><strong>article 5: judicial department</strong>: two supreme courts (criminal cases and civil cases); texas constitution creates independent judiciary that can check and balance the other two branches; all justices and judges are elected, enabling people to watch over courts</li>
<li><strong>article 6: suffrage</strong>: who can vote in TX; enables legislature to regulate voter registration and selection of electors</li>
<li><strong>article 7: education</strong>: public schools promote republican form of govt; requires texas to support, maintain, and fund efficient system of public education; establishes and funds public universities (ut and TAM)</li>
<li><strong>article 8: taxation and revenue</strong></li>
<li><strong>article 9 and 11: local government</strong></li>
<li><strong>article 10, 12-14</strong>: railroads, private corp, spanish and mexico land title, public lands</li>
<li><strong>article 15: impeachment</strong>: formal charge by which state official is removed from office, house and senate decide what constitutes impeachable offense</li>
<li><strong>article 16: general provisions</strong>: one of the legnthiest articles, catchall article tackling variety of issues</li>
<li><strong>article 17: amending constitution</strong>: four-stage process, legislature proposes amednment, approved with 2/3 majority, explanations of amendments must be published twice, majority of state voters must approve in statewide election</li>
<li><strong>2017: constitutional amendments</strong>: 7 proposed, all passed, voter turnout was low at about 5.7%; two possible reasons: amendment votes are held in off years; amendments are relatively insignificant</li>
</ul>

<h1>(9/11/19) public finance</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>why public finance matters</strong>: among other things, public finance affects the cost going to college; tuition skyrocketed in first decade of 21st century (example: tuition and fees for texas a and m at texarkana rose 132% between 2003 and 2016); passing a balanced budget is the most important task, it requires identifying priorities and allocating money accordingly</li>
<li>the texas constitution mandates a "balanced budget"; public finance is a complicated business and the devil is in the details; funds that constitute the "budget" can be divided into five broad budgetary categories</li>
<li><strong>general revenue funds</strong>: nondedicated revenue account that functions as the state's primary operating fund</li>
<li><strong>general revenue-dedicated funds</strong>: budget composed of funds for dedicated revenues that target money for specific purposes</li>
<li><strong>federal funds</strong>: includes all grants, payments, and reimbursements received from federal govt by state agencies and institutions</li>
<li><strong>other funds</strong>: consists of all other funds flowing into the state treasury that are not included in other state budgets; includes texas highway fund, various trust funds operated by the state, and certain revenues held for local higher education accounts</li>
<li><strong>all funds</strong>: aggregate of all other budgets; all spending that goes through agencies, including federal and state programs</li>
<li>the state budget involves huge amounts of money; 78 billion on health and human services, 80 bill for education, there is a great pressure to maximize federal dollars and to minimize state spending and not raise taxes</li>
<li>texas has a reputation for being low service, low tax state that maintains a favorable environment for business; the number of state workers is smaller than in other states</li>
<li>revenue in texas: taxes are an important element of public finance; two measures are often used to compare tax burdens (state and local tax burden per capita and state tax collections per capita); texas is one of seven states with no personal income tax, but there is a high sales tax; texas has relatively high property taxes</li>
<li>government and public policy are funded from a variety of sources: sales tax is the most important single tax (6.25%); oil and natural gas production and regulation, tax revenue varies with the price and volume; oil production is taxed based on market value; tax is 4.6% of the market value of oil produced in the state; oil revenues have a projected increase of 29.7% from $3.8 billion to 4.9 billion</li>
<li>natural gas production tax - 7.5% of market value</li>
<li>motor fuel tax - 20 cents per gallon, part of dedicated fund for public roads and education</li>
<li>the question of income tax in texas; with a regressive tax, tax burden falls on low income individuals; progressive tax falls on upper income; few politicians have been willing to support an income tax in texas</li>
<li>federal grants and <strong>matching funds</strong> re low, but federal aid to texas has been increasing</li>
</ul>

<!---->

<h1>(9/16/19)</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>state funds</strong>: money spent by the state doesn't just flow into and out of a single pot; about 400 funds direct money to a wide variety of functions; an understanding of how money flows lies at the heart of mastering the state budget</li>
<li>the <strong>general revenue fund</strong> is the state's primary operating fund; nondedicated general revenue; general revenue: dedicated accounts</li>
<li>the <strong>permanent school fund</strong> funds primary and secondary schools; distributes funds to school districts across state based on attendance and similar criteria; amount of money available to public education through the psf is determined by the state board of education</li>
<li>the <strong>available school fund</strong> is a dedicated fund for support of public education; funded through distributions of the psf</li>
<li>the purposes of the <strong>state highway fund</strong> are constructing, maintaining, and policing roadways of texas and acquiring rights of way</li>
<li>the <strong>economic stabilization fund</strong> or rainy day fund is meant to provide relief during times of financial distress</li>
<li>university ones:
<ul><li><strong>permanent university fund</strong>: supports most institutions of UT and texas AM</li>
<li><strong>higher education fund</strong>: supports universities that do not have access to puf monies</li>
<li><strong>national research university fund</strong>: funds effforts to achieve national prominence as research institutions</li></ul>
</li>
<li>constitutional factors affect how texas budget is made: legislature must write a two-year budget and meets only once every two years; agencies are forced to protect budgetary needs without clear knowledge of the problems to be faced in two years; large portion of the biennial budget is dedicated for special purposes by federal law or by the texas constitution or state statute</li>
<li>according to <strong>article 3, section 49a (pay-as-you-go limit)</strong>, the state must maintain a balanced budget; all bills that get as far as <strong>appropriations</strong> must be sent to the comptroller, putting the comptroller at the heart of the budget process</li>
<li>article 3, section 51a, limits spending for needy dependent children to 1% of state budget</li>
<li>article 8, section 22, limits the growth of certain appropriations; when the state's economy shrinks, appropriations also have to shrink; decided by Legislative Budget Board</li>
<li>article 16, section 69 assigns budget-execution authority to governor and LBB</li>
<li>article 3, section 49j limits the amount of debt the state can incur, based on the resulting <bold>debt service</bold></li>
<li>texas has a dual budget system; governor's office of budget, planning, and policy and the lbb; budget is primarily responsibility of legislature</li>
<li>budgetary process involves two stages: development of draft budget by the lbb; legislative process, by which appropriations bulls make their way through the committee process</li>
<li>texas must pass a balanced budget every two years</li>
<li>budgetary process is full of uncertainty as projecting expenditures and future revenues is difficult</li>
<li>at times, periods of economic boom can create an unexpected surplus</li>
<li>in 2017, due to low oil and natural gas prices as well as declining production, texas was experiencing a budget deficit; addressing this problem required creative solutions and belt-tightening</li>
<li>as long as conservative republicans are in power, cutting taxes will always be high on agenda; expanding social welfare or education programs will not likely take priority</li>
</ul>
